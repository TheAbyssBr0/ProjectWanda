Target word highlighter - it is a tool that highlights all the matching words/phrases (called targets) in a given input. In other words, it searches for multiple words in the input and highlights all of the occurances of the given words.

This was suggested to me by a friend who wanted such a tool but I also took the opportunity to practice optimising performance.
